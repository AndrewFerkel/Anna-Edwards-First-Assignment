 # Overview #
  Agriculture is a tough job, but farming the land and caring for livestock can lead to a very satisfying, enriching and rewarding way of life. In order to successfully nurture both the land and livestock in your care you must consider the business aspects of your operation.  There are numerous aspects to consider if you are thinking about starting any kind of agricultural business. These aspects include choosing an enterprise within agriculture that you enjoy, developing a business plan, developing a risk management strategy, marketing and advertising, and financial management. 

  Starting a business in agriculture can be an extremely daunting prospect! This tutorial intends to take the previously stated aspects of establishing an agricultural business and expand and explain the importance of each aspect. This is not meant to be an all inclusive look into starting a farm, but merely an overview that helps you on your way to creating a successful agricultural business.
  
 # Choosing an Enterprise #
  Choosing an enterprise includes more than just picking an aspect of farming that you think would be successful and then starting a business. While choosing an enterprise does include this, it also includes choosing an enterprise that you will enjoy in the years that will follow. Some questions to ask yourself when choosing your enterprise are
  
* What am I going to plant/breed?
* Will I enjoy it in a few years?
* What is my ultimate goal for my new agricultural business
* How much will I sell it for and when do I expect to see profit?
*	What equipment do I need? Who will fix it?
* Can I weather a bad year?
* Can I make changes to stay in business?
